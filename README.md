# bash-scripts
1. Clone repo and run the following commands:

```
sudo chmod +x setup-bashrc.sh
sudo chmod +x setup-dev-environment.sh
sudo chmod +x setup-git-prompt.sh
sudo chmod +x anyconnect-install.sh
```
2. Go to: https://www.oracle.com/tools/downloads/sqldev-downloads.html and download SQL Developer (the Other Platforms one so you get the `.zip` file) and put it into the same directory as the repo
3. Run `./setup-dev-environment.sh`
4. (Optional) Run `./setup-bashrc.sh` to have git prompt and git completion added to your bashrc. Feel free to edit the PS1 line in the script to make it how you want.
